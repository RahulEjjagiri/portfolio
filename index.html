            <h3>“RFID BASED PETROL PUMP AUTOMATION SYSTEM”</h3>
            <p>Description of project.</p>
            <p>through UART interfaces. AC pump operated by relay which is connected to Arduino digital pin. 4X4 matrix keypad connected to Arduino digital pins.
            <br>In this project initially we have to swipe RFID card and need to enter password. If password is correct then it asks amount. After entering amount pump will ON and fuel will dispense according to amount. For wrong password buzzer will be ON. Amount will reduced from RFID card based on entered amount.</br>
